# Forum Webscraper
Collects comments, user information, and meta data from two specific online community forums that discuss new child protection laws. *(Site information is protected.)*

This webscraper was built to support faculty research at Wesleyan University within the [Science in Society Program Department](https://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/). The collected text data will be leveraged to identify ambiguous language in recent child protection laws and to offer revisions to clarify legal documents.
